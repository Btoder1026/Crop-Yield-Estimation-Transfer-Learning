# Task 1A (20 points)
Replicate the results of the code in the repository ensuring that you train the model with a much larger number of images, epochs and other parameters of your choice to present the best possible performance.

To replicate the results of the code in the given repository, we will follow the steps outlined in the notebook. However, we will make some modifications to train the model with a larger number of images, epochs, and other parameters of our choice for improved performance.

Here's an overview of the steps we will follow:

Dataset Preparation:
Gather a larger dataset of drone images showing the health of crops and the corresponding yield information.
Organize the dataset into appropriate directories, separating images by their class labels (e.g., healthy, diseased, etc.) and creating a CSV file with image paths and corresponding labels.
Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the images to enhance features and remove noise if required.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Model Architecture:
Choose a suitable deep learning architecture for the task, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Customize the architecture based on the specific requirements of crop yield estimation.
Model Training:
Set up the model training pipeline with appropriate hyperparameters.
Train the model on the training dataset for a larger number of epochs to allow the model to learn complex patterns and generalize better.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset to assess its performance in predicting crop yield.
Calculate relevant evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization (Optional):
If the initial model performance is not satisfactory, consider fine-tuning the model architecture or optimizing hyperparameters to improve the results.
Iterate on the model training and evaluation steps until satisfactory performance is achieved.
