Task 2: Transfer Learning for tf_flowers Dataset

To replicate the results for the model described in the "tf_flowers" dataset using transfer learning, we will follow the steps outlined in the provided notebook. Here's an overview of the steps:

Dataset Preparation:
Obtain the "tf_flowers" dataset, which contains labeled images of different flower species.
Preprocess the dataset by splitting it into training and validation sets.

Model Architecture:
Choose a pre-trained CNN model, such as VGG16 or InceptionV3, as the base model for transfer learning.
Remove the original classification layer(s) of the base model.

Transfer Learning:
Freeze the weights of the pre-trained layers in the base model to retain their learned representations.
Add new trainable layers on top of the base model.
Train the model on the training dataset using the new layers while keeping the base model weights frozen.

Fine-tuning (Optional):
If necessary, unfreeze some of the lower layers of the base model.
Retrain the entire model with a lower learning rate to fine-tune the network's weights on the specific task.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset to assess its performance in flower species classification.
Compare the classification results obtained with and without transfer learning.

By following the provided notebook and replicating the steps for transfer learning on the "tf_flowers" dataset, we can observe and compare the classification results achieved with and without transfer learning techniques.
