Task 1B: Separating Bad Cropy 

To separate bad crops based on the percentage of bad berries, we can follow the steps below:

Generate Images:
Generate a set of drone images with varying percentages of bad berries (0% to 100%) using a uniform random sampling method.
Ensure that the total number of berries remains consistent while changing the percentage of bad berries.

Data Labeling:
Assign binary labels to each image based on the percentage of bad berries.
A label of 0 can represent a good crop (when black berries are less than or equal to 50% of the total), and a label of 1 can represent a bad crop (when black berries exceed 50%).

Model Training:
Utilize the same model architecture and training pipeline as in Task 1A.
Train the model on the labeled dataset, where the percentage of bad berries acts as the target label.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model's performance in classifying images as good or bad crops based on the percentage of bad berries.
Calculate relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

By following this approach, we can build a model that predicts crop yield based on drone images and also classify crops as good or bad based on the percentage of bad berries.
